File organization: 

- scripts - all scripts for processing/visualizations 
- processed-data - place datasets that have undergone processing/cleaning here
- data - place raw data here (note: currently we have dated folders outside of this folder, should move these here later)
- ConductR - files related to measuring hydraulics in ConductR 
- figures - save figures here as they are created
- random-stuff - put other items here so they don't clutter the main folder
